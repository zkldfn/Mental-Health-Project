Machine Learning Project

Mental Health Classification Web Application. Developed a web application that classifies users into different mental health categories using a machine learning model. The website was built with Python and HTML templates, allowing users to input data and receive predictions. This project gave me hands-on experience in integrating ML models with a functional web interface.
